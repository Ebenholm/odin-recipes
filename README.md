This project is a website that showcases a few recipes. 

Its' purpose is not to actually be useful, but to be a teaching experience for me
as a webdeveloper. First I'll learn HTML on here, and then afterwards I'll learn to
use css on it. 

This is a part of the curriculum of the Odin project found here:
