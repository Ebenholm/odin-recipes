        <h1>Mousse Cake</h1>
        <img src="../images/MouseTort.jpg" alt="Image of a Mousse Cake" height="600">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe was one I found on koket.se from Camilla Hamid, an excellent recourse
            for anything pastry related!
        </p>
        <p>The recipe takes a long time to follow since the cake itself has three layers which all
            need some time to settle before moving over to the other layers. If you are to follow
            the recipe then an amazingly wonderfully looking and tasting cake awaits. 
        </p>

            <li>100 g dark chocolate (atleast 55% cacoa)</li>
            <li>2 eggyolks</li>
            <li>2 dl whipped cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Third part</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>225 g frosen raspberry</li>
            <li>2 tbsp water</li>
            <li>0,5 tsp agar-agar</li>
            <li>1 dl powdered sugar</li>
            <li>whipped cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Top part</h3>
        <ol>    
            <li>Put the over on 175 degrees celcius on over- and heat and line a 23cm diameter springform with baking paper.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a scaucepan and let it cool down. Mix the butter with the rest of the ingredients
                in a bowl just to the point where it all comes togheter into an even batter.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the spring form and let it bake in the middle of the over for 15-20 minutes
                or until the sides of the bottom are solid while the middle is a little wobbly.
            </li>
            <li>Let it cool down in the fridge for atleast 4 hours, preferably the bottom should cool in the fride for the whole night.

            </li>
        </ol> 
        <h3>Middle part</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the dark chocolate roughly and put it in a heat resistant bowl</li>
            <li>Melt the chocolate over a waterbath or in a microwave.</li>
            <li>Mix an eggyolk at a time into the warm chocolate. Mix with every yolk. The batter
                will get thicker and thicker with every yolk.
            </li>
            <li>whip the whipped cream in another bowl until it has soft peaks with a whisk, electrical or otherwise.</li>
            <li>Mmix down 1/3 of the whipped cream into the chocolate batter. After mixing, mix the batter into the rest of the 
                whipped cream and mix it into an even batter.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the springform, on top of the first layer that you've made. Even 
                the batter out and put it into the fridge for atleast 1 hour before adding the third and final layer.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Third layer</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the frosen berries in a saucepan untill they have loosened entirely.</li>
            <li>Strain the raspberry mush to get rid of the kernels. Cook them up again togheter with the agar-agar
                and powdered sugar. Let it boil while stirring for around 3-4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Pour it into a bowl and let it cool and thicken in room temperature. It should
                become a thick and soft puré. Don't let it stay cooling for to long, as it might make the 
                puré hard.
            </li>
            <li>Whip the whipped cream, but not to hard, you need some margins when whipping the berrymousse down
                into the whipped cream so that it mixes well. Mix the berrymousse and whip it a little. Pour
                the mousse over the second layer of the cake and put the cake back into the fride and let the 
                top layer harden in there for atleast 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Done! Additional berries can be added ontop for decoration, aswell as whipped cream!</li>
        </ol>
